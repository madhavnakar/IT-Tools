Computer Information Finder (CompInfoFinder):

This is a PowerShell script created to help IT Professionals. The script takes as input the hostname of a (Windows) domain computer and returns the hard drive size, hard drive type (HDD or SSD), RAM size, TPM state, users on the computer, applications installed and other useful characteristics.
This script uses WinRM (windows remote management) hence that needs to be enabled on the target computer.
